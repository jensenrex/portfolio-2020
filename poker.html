                 <p> Live poker has its own special skill set- that very few people teach, and there are very few resources online that focus on this niche of the poker world. And yet live texas hold’em tournament poker is the weakest form of poker in the world.

               <p>    I final tabled the <a href="https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/event.php?a=r&n=493566">$1,500 Australian Poker League Million Main Event</a> back to back at Sydney's Star casino- both years had fields of over 1,000 players. In 2018 when we got down to the final 3, we chopped the remaining $460,000 prize pool. In 2019, I finished 9th out of 1,294 players.

        The pandemic has closed poker tournaments in Sydney and has given you an opportunity to pick my brains and have me design individual lessons for your game.

              <p>        I provide poker coaching that analyses your game, and I give you actionable and achievable tasks to do after each session, which we then review at the next session. Every lesson is one-of-a-kind that will help you achieve your poker goals. You will be able to implement what I teach at the tables immediately.

                I am not a full time coach, I play and study a lot! But I am a teacher at heart and love to train and develop students. 
                The teaching sessions can be online by video call or in person in Sydney.
